1 Key Term
Configuration
A set of parameters or constants that are critical to a system. Configuration is typically written in JSON or YAML and can be either static, meaning that it's hard-coded in and shipped with your system's application code (like frontend code, for instance), or dynamic, meaning that it lives outside of your system's application code.
