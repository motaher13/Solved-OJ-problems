Relational Database
A type of structured database in which data is stored following a tabular format; often supports powerful querying using SQL.

Non-Relational Database
In contrast with relational database (SQL databases), a type of database that is free of imposed, tabular-like structure. Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases.


4 Key Terms
Key-Value Store
A Key-Value Store is a flexible NoSQL database that's often used for caching and dynamic configuration. Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, and ZooKeeper.

Etcd
Etcd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement leader election in a system.

Redis
An in-memory key-value store. Does offer some persistent storage options but is typically used as a really fast, best-effort caching solution. Redis is also often used to implement rate limiting.

ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is a strongly consistent, highly available key-value store. It's often used to store important configuration or to perform leader election.
