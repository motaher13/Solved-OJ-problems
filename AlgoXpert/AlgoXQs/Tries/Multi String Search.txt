Write a function that takes in a big string and an array of small strings, all of which are smaller in length than the big string. The function should return an array of booleans, where each boolean represents whether the small string at that index in the array of small strings is contained in the big string.

Note that you can't use language-built-in string-matching methods.

Sample Input #1
bigString = "this is a big string"
          smallStrings = ["this", "yo", "is", "a", "bigger", "string", "kappa"]
          
Sample Output #1
[true, false, true, true, false, true, false]
          
Sample Input #2
bigString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
          smallStrings = ["abc", "mnopqr", "wyz", "no", "e", "tuuv"]
          
Sample Output #2
[true, true, false, true, true, false]
          
Hints
Hint 1
A simple way to solve this problem is to iterate through all of the small strings, checking if each of them is contained in the big string by iterating through the big string's characters and comparing them to the given small string's characters with a couple of loops. Is this approach efficient from a time-complexity point of view?

Hint 2
Try building a suffix-trie-like data structure containing all of the big string's suffixes. Then, iterate through all of the small strings and check if each of them is contained in the data structure you've created. What are the time-complexity ramifications of this approach?

Hint 3
Try building a trie containing all of the small strings. Then, iterate through the big string's characters and check if any part of the big string is a string contained in the trie you've created. Is this approach better than the one described in Hint #2 from a time-complexity point of view?

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(ns + bs) time | O(ns) space - where n is the number of small strings, s is the length of longest small string, and b is the length of the big string
